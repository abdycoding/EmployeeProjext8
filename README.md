# Employee Management System

Welcome to the **Employee Management System**! This Java-based application allows you to manage employee records efficiently, with functionalities including adding new employees, deleting employees by their ID, and applying salary raises based on department codes.

## Features

- **Employee Operations**: 
  - Add new employees with their name, salary, and department code.
  - Delete employees by their unique ID.
  - Apply salary raises to employees based on their department's raise rate.

- **View Employees**: 
  - List all employees in the system.
  - Filter and view employees by their department.

## How to Use

1. **Starting the Application**: 
   - Run the `MainClass` to start the employee management panel.
   - The application presents a simple console menu where you can choose different operations.

2. **Operations**:
   - **Add Employee**: Enter the employee's name, salary, and department code to add them to the system.
   - **Delete Employee**: Provide the employee's ID to remove them from the system.
   - **Apply Raise**: Enter the employee's ID to apply a salary raise based on their department's raise percentage.
   - **View Employees**: You can view all employees or filter them by department.

3. **Exiting**: Choose the "Exit" option to safely close the application.

## Code Structure

- **MainClass**: The entry point of the application. It handles the user interface and menu navigation.
- **Calisan**: Represents an employee with attributes like ID, name, salary, and department code.
- **Calisanlar**: A database-like class that manages the list of employees, providing methods to add, delete, and view employees.
- **YonetimDepartmani**: Handles department-specific operations, such as retrieving the raise percentage.

## Future Improvements

- Add a user authentication system for enhanced security.
- Implement persistent data storage using a database.
- Expand the system to support additional employee attributes and operations.
